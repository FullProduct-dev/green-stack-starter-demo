## The [FullProduct.dev](https://fullproduct.dev?v=gh-demo-readme) üöÄ Starterkit

- **Universal from the Start üôå + Write-once UI:**
  - Build for web, iOS, and Android with a single codebase.
  - No more writing features twice / 3x - 90%+ of your UI and logic = shared across platforms.
  - Use React Native primitives (`View`, `Text`, `Image`) + NativeWind for max portability while still styling your universal UI with Tailwind.

- **The GREEN Stack ‚úÖ for an *Evergreen* project setup:**
  - **G**raphQL, **R**eact-Native, **E**xpo, **N**ext.js.
  - Designed to be powerful, future-proof, flexible, and easy to evolve as your project grows.

- **Copy-Pasteable üìÇ - Monorepo Architecture:**
  - Turborepo config already set up for you.
  - Features are organized by domain, not by front-end/back-end split. This makes it easy to copy, reuse, and scale features between projects.
  - Each feature workspace is self-contained: UI, API, models, schemas, utils, and more... All co-located in portable workspace packages.

- **Single Sources of Truth üíé - The Right Abstractions**
  - Define your data shape once using Zod schemas, and derive or (auto-)generate types, validation, docs, db models, and more from them.
  - Avoid bugs and wasted time by keeping your types, validation, and docs in sync automatically.

- **Universal Data Fetching üîÄ - For Expo and Next.js**
  - GraphQL + React Query for type-safe, cross-platform data fetching.
  - Fetch data the same way on server, browser, and mobile.

- **Modern DX & Codegen ‚öôÔ∏è - Beyond just the Setup**
  - Built-in code generators for schemas, resolvers, forms, and more.
  - Fast monorepo setup with Turborepo (or use standalone if you prefer).

- **Rich Interactive Docs üìö - Automatically grow with your project**
  - Full documentation at [fullproduct.dev/docs](https://fullproduct.dev/docs?v=gh-demo-readme)
  - Best practices and guides included in the built-in docs
  - Automatic UI, API and Types docs generation from Zod schemas
  - Easy Onboardings / Handovers, *Great Context for LLMs*

## üü¢ The GREEN Stack:

> üìó **Docs** at [Fullproduct.dev/docs](https://fullproduct.dev/docs)

The goal of any tech stack should be to stay **'Evergreen'**

- ‚úÖ **GraphQL** - Universal, type-safe data fetching
- ‚úÖ **React-Native** - Write-once UI that feels native
- ‚úÖ **Expo** - Cross-platform app dev (Web / iOS / Android)
- ‚úÖ **EAS** - Effortless builds and deploys to App Stores
- ‚úÖ **Next.js** - Web-vitals and best-in-class SSR / SEO optimization

These are proven and widely supported technologies.

> Paired with TypeScript, Zod, and Tailwind (via Nativewind), this stack is designed to be robust, flexible, and here to stay. While still allowing you the freedom to choose your own Database and other core stack choices.

## üì¶ What‚Äôs Included? - Demo

- **I'm just starting out, should I use it?**
  - If you know the basics of JS/React, this kit will teach you how to build universal apps that can be used in a browser / found in Google, but also be installable from the iOS / Android App Stores.
  - Learning `react-native` and `expo` is a great skill potential employers will appreciate.
  - Built-in docs will help AI coding assistants better understand your project.
- **I'm an experienced dev, why should I use it?**
  - Seniors know the right abstractions can save weeks / months of time. Start with them.
  - Eases onboardings and handovers thanks to built-in docs that automatically grow as you build.
  - Spend less time on boilerplate thanks to our generators and automation scripts.

## üõ† Getting Started

Use **`git clone`**, or the GitHub UI to ‚ùáÔ∏è **[generate a new project](https://github.com/new?template_name=green-stack-starter-demo&template_owner=FullProduct-dev)** from our **[template repo](https://github.com/FullProduct-dev/green-stack-starter-demo)**, then run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) for the Next.js app (web)
- Use [Expo Go](https://expo.io/client) or `npm run ios` / `npm run android` to test mobile
