# FullProduct.dev Demo Source-Available License (FDSAL)

**Version 1.1 — 2026-01-27**

Copyright (c) 2025–2026 Aetherspace Digital (FullProduct.dev).  
All rights reserved.

This license governs use of the FullProduct.dev “GREEN Stack Starter Demo” repository
(the “Software”). By using, copying, modifying, or distributing the Software, you agree
to this license.

## Definitions

- **End Product**: a specific web and/or mobile application you build using the Software.
- **Starter/Template**: a generalized or reusable codebase intended to be used as a
  starting point for multiple different End Products by you or others.
- **Third party**: any person or entity other than you; however, for purposes of Sections
  5(c) and 5(d), a client and that client’s employees/contractors working on the same End
  Product are permitted recipients of an End Product codebase.

## Paid License Override (Order of Precedence)

If you have purchased a valid paid FullProduct.dev license, then:

- the restrictions in **Section 5** (No Private Redistribution of the Starter), and
- the attribution requirements in **Section 6**

may be waived, but only to the extent permitted by your paid license/EULA.

In case of conflict, the paid license/EULA controls for the paid components and for any
waivers it grants.

## 1. License Grant (Demo)

Subject to the terms below, we grant you a non-exclusive, worldwide, revocable license to:

1. view and use the Software;
2. modify the Software to build End Products;
3. use the Software to perform paid development services for clients, including building
   End Products for clients, provided you comply with this license;
4. distribute End Products you build with the Software; and
5. redistribute the Software only as permitted in **Section 4** (Redistribution).

## 2. Commercial Use (Allowed Under Threshold)

Commercial use is allowed provided that, in the prior 12 months, you have not generated
**USD $10,000 or more** in gross revenue that is attributable to:

1. an End Product built with the Software, and/or
2. services substantially enabled by the Software

(the **Revenue Threshold**).

If you meet or exceed the Revenue Threshold, you must obtain a paid FullProduct.dev
license to continue using the Software for commercial purposes.

## 3. No Premium Features; No Mixing Premium Code

The demo Software does not include premium features (for example: CLI workflows,
installable PRs, auto-documentation, or other premium plugins).

You may not copy, incorporate, or distribute any premium FullProduct.dev code, features,
or plugins unless you have a valid paid license for those premium components. If you are
licensed for premium components, you must comply with the applicable commercial
license/EULA for those components.

## 4. Redistribution (Demo Only) — Allowed With Conditions

You may redistribute the unmodified Software, or your modified version of the Software,
provided that:

1. the redistributed code contains only demo-version code and does not contain any premium
   code/features/plugins;
2. you include this `LICENSE.md` file in full with the redistributed code;
3. you do not represent the redistributed code as an official FullProduct.dev release; and
4. you comply with the attribution requirements in **Section 6** (unless waived under
   **Section 0** by a paid license).

## 5. No Private Redistribution of the Starter (Demo)

You may not distribute the Software (including modified versions) as a reusable
Starter/Template, boilerplate, or codebase in any private manner to any third party
(including but not limited to: private GitHub forks, private mirrors, private repos, zipped
downloads, or direct sharing), except as permitted by a paid license under **Section 0**.

### Clarifications

1. This restriction does **not** prohibit you from performing paid client work using the
   Software, as long as you do not provide the Software itself to the client (or any other
   third party) as a reusable Starter/Template/codebase.
2. This restriction does **not** prohibit you from keeping your End Product source code
   private, so long as you are not distributing the Software itself as a reusable
   Starter/Template/codebase to third parties.
3. Delivering an End Product codebase to a client is permitted, provided that the delivered
   codebase is a specific End Product (not marketed, packaged, or intended as a reusable
   Starter/Template) and you continue to comply with this license (including **Section 3**
   and **Section 6** unless waived under **Section 0**).
4. Sharing an End Product codebase with the client’s employees and contractors who are
   working on that End Product is permitted, provided it is for the purpose of developing,
   maintaining, or operating that End Product and not for creating or distributing a reusable
   Starter/Template.
5. You must not provide the Software to any third party as a separate “clean starter” or
   “base template” repository, even if you also deliver an End Product.

## 6. Attribution Requirements (README + End Product) (Waivable With Paid License)

Unless waived under **Section 0** by a paid license, if you redistribute the Software
(**Section 4**) or ship an End Product built with the Software, you must provide attribution
as follows:

### (a) README attribution (for redistributed Software or source-available starters)

Keep an attribution section in the README that states the project is based on FullProduct.dev
and links to:

- https://fullproduct.dev
- the original demo repository URL (or your public redistribution URL)

### (b) End Product attribution (for shipped apps/websites)

Include a visible attribution in the End Product, such as in “About”, “Settings”, “Legal”,
an in-app credits screen, or a website footer, stating **“Built with FullProduct.dev”**
(or similar) and linking to https://fullproduct.dev where technically feasible.

You may satisfy this for native mobile apps by including the attribution in a “Legal”,
“About”, or “Libraries” screen.

## 7. Restrictions

Except as expressly permitted by this license, you may not:

1. sell, sublicense, or resell the Software as a starter kit, template, boilerplate, or codebase;
2. make the Software available to end users as a product whose primary purpose is to provide
   access to the Software as a Starter/Template; or
3. remove or alter copyright, trademark, or licensing notices included with the Software.

## 8. Trademarks

“FullProduct.dev” and related marks/logos are trademarks of Aetherspace Digital.

This license does not grant any rights to use our trademarks except for:

1. the attribution required by **Section 6**, and
2. truthful, nominative use.

## 9. Warranty Disclaimer

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

## 10. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR AUTHORS BE
LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT,
OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER
DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE
SOFTWARE (IF ANY).

## 11. Termination

If you violate this license, your rights under this license terminate automatically. Upon
termination, you must stop using and distributing the Software, except that End Products
already distributed may continue to be used by end users.
